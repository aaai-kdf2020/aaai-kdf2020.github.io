<h2>Introduction</h2>

Knowledge discovery from unstructureddata has gained the attention of many practitioners over the past decades. In spite of majorAIresearch focusing on data sources likenews, web, and social media, its application to data in professional settings such as legal documentsandfinancial filings, still present huge challenges. 

In the financial services industry in particular, vast analysiswork requires knowledge discovery from various data sources, such as SEC filings, loan documents, and industry reports. The manual knowledge discovery and extraction process is usually low in efficiency, error prone, and inconsistent. It is one ofthe key bottlenecks for financial services companies in improving their operating productivity. Furthermore, alternative data like social media feeds and news are gaining traction as promising knowledge sources for financial institutions as they provide additional perspectives when they make investment decisions. However, the valuable knowledge is always comingled with immense noise and the precision and recall requirements for extracted knowledgeto be used in business processare fastidious.

These challenges and issues call for the need of robust artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and systems. The design and implementation of these AI techniques to meet financial business operations requires the joint effort between academia researchers and industry practitioners. 

We cordially welcome researchers, practitioners, and students from academic and industrial communities who are interested in the topics to participate; at least one author of each accepted submission must be present at the workshop.

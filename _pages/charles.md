<h2>Machine Learning in Finance - Lessons Learned</h2>
This talk will discuss how machine learning (ML) fits into the landscape of quantitative methods used in finance, and draw conclusions about domains where ML is promising, versus domains where the perils are acute. The talk will also discuss how to formulate a business objective as an ML problem, how to choose between solution approaches, and how to manage ML projects.
